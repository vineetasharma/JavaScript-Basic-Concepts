/**
 * Until this moment, generators were similar to iterable objects, with a special syntax to generate values. 
 * But in fact they are much more powerful and flexible.
 * Thatâ€™s because yield is a two-way street: it not only returns the result to the outside,
 * but also can pass the value inside the generator.
 * To do so, we should call generator.next(arg), with an argument. That argument becomes the result of yield.
