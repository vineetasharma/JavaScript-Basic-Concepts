# JavaScript-Basic-Concepts
## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and
display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.
It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which HTML and CSS.

**HTML** *is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.*

**CSS** *is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in 
multiple columns.*

**JavaScript** *is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)*

The three layers build on top of one another nicely.

## So what can it really do?
The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:

1.Store useful values inside variables.
2.Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming).
3.Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. And much more!
